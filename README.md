# Tetris-2.0
Repo for my tetris clone

This project consists in writing a tetris clone with a vs mode, to eventually develop an AI.
Development for this project has stopped completely. I will soon start developing a new version in C. This repository may become unavailable in the future. 

## How to install ?

- Make sure the FreePascal Compiler (fpc) is installed. If it is not you can install it with `sudo apt install fpc` on Debian.

- Go into the Tetris-2.0 and execute the compiling script with `./compile.sh`. It should create the bin directory and create a bunch of files into it. The program is now installed and compiled properly assuming you didn't get any error message during compilation.

## How to play ?
 Simply execute the execution script, with `./execute.sh`. The game should launch in the terminal.
